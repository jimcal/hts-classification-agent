# Footwear Image Capture Requirements

## Required Views
Each footwear item requires a minimum of three (3) distinct views for accurate material analysis:

### 1. Lateral (Outside) View
- Position: Shoe placed on flat surface, photographed from outer side
- Angle: Camera parallel to ground, 90째 to shoe's midline
- Distance: Fill frame with shoe while maintaining 10% margin
- Focus: Sharp detail of material textures and transitions
- Lighting: Diffused, even illumination without harsh shadows

### 2. Medial (Inside) View
- Position: Mirror of lateral view, showing inner side
- Angle: Same as lateral view, opposite side
- Distance: Maintain consistent framing with lateral view
- Focus: Capture all material transitions and overlays
- Lighting: Consistent with lateral view

### 3. Top-Down View
- Position: Shoe placed flat, photographed from above
- Angle: Camera 90째 perpendicular to ground
- Distance: Capture entire upper surface with 10% margin
- Focus: Clear visibility of tongue and lacing area
- Lighting: Minimize shadows from high areas

## Optional but Recommended Views
- Back View: Captures heel construction and material transitions
- 45째 Angle View: Shows material interactions at key flex points
- Close-up Details: For complex material transitions or special features

## Technical Requirements

### Image Quality
- Resolution: Minimum 2048 x 1536 pixels (3MP)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Compression: Minimal, quality setting 80% or higher
- File size: 1MB - 10MB per image

### Lighting Conditions
- Type: Diffused, natural or LED lighting
- Direction: 45째 angle from above
- Intensity: Sufficient to show texture without washing out details
- Avoid: Direct sunlight, harsh shadows, reflective glare

### Background
- Color: Neutral (gray preferred)
- Type: Non-reflective, matte surface
- Contrast: Must differ from shoe colors
- Clear: No other objects in frame

### Scale Reference
- Include a standard size reference in first image
- Ruler or calibration marker visible but not obscuring shoe

## Common Issues to Avoid
1. Motion Blur: Use stable platform or tripod
2. Insufficient Resolution: Maintain minimum pixel requirements
3. Poor Focus: Ensure sharp detail of material textures
4. Uneven Lighting: Eliminate harsh shadows and hot spots
5. Incomplete Coverage: Show all material transitions
6. Background Clutter: Use clean, neutral background

## Validation Criteria
Images will be automatically checked for:
1. Resolution and quality requirements
2. Proper angle alignment
3. Adequate lighting conditions
4. Clear material visibility
5. Complete coverage of required views
